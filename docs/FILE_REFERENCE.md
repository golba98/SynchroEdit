# SyncroEdit File Reference

This is the ownership and retention guide for the repository. Every retained first-party file is
listed individually. Vendored packages and their opaque generated binaries are grouped because
their internal files are maintained upstream rather than edited as SyncroEdit source.

Use this guide when locating behavior, adding tests, or deciding whether a file can be removed. A
file is retained when it is a runtime entrypoint, is reachable from an entrypoint, defines a
deployment or security contract, records migration history, verifies behavior, or documents an
operational requirement.

For an annotated directory tree and dependency flows between these files, read
[PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).

## D1 Migration History

Migrations are append-only deployment history. They remain even when later migrations supersede
individual values because existing databases replay the sequence in order.

## Intentionally Local-Only Files

These paths are ignored and are not part of the deployable repository. They are preserved because
they may contain local secrets or user-specific tool settings.

`node_modules/` is reproducible from `package-lock.json`. `.wrangler/`, `test-results/`,
`playwright-report/`, coverage output, logs, and empty directories are disposable generated state
and should not be retained after a cleanup pass.
